the idea is to break the app by functionality type (eg. compoments, services)
inside of each functionality module, break by domain (eg. auth, product, order)

src
 │
 ├── components (organized by domain)
 │  ├── auth (signin, signup, etc..)
 │  ├── product(product-details, product-list, etc...)
 │
 ├── state (aka ducks)
 │  ├── index.js (combineReducers + complex selectors)
 │  ├── auth.js (reducers, action types, actions creators, selectors)
 │  └── product.js (reducers, action types, actions creators, selectors) - turn the file into a directory, if necessary (eg. product/productDetails, product/productSearch)
 │
 ├── sagas
 │  ├── index.js (root saga / table of content of all the sagas)
 │  ├── auth.js
 │  └── product.js - file can be turned into a directory, as necessary
 │
 └── services
    ├── authenticationService.js
    └── productsApi.js
